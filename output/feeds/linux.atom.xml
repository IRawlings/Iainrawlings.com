All of these are set  up to use SSH private keys to access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these have all been set up over many years and at different points the key situation was a bit of a mess. So today I decided to remedy that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;replacing the keys on the devices to make access simpler for myself I ran into an odd problem due to my use of Pageant for the forwarding agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Pagent means I have to convert the keys to .ppk files to load them for forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However when generating a new key, Puttygen would not import the keypair. A quick google suggested that I would need to convert the format of the key to PEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the following command from the ssh folder on my pi 4: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -p -f id_rsa -m PEM&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forces the password to be changed (providing you can supply the old one of course!) and changes the format to PEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had done this and passed the key to Puttygen, I was able to load and convert to .ppk and add to Pageant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a note, if you've ended up here because you're struggling with SSH keys not validating, you should also check the permissions of the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh&lt;/code&gt; folder and all files within it such as &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; and the private and publoc keyfiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category><category term="SSH"></category></entry></feed>
