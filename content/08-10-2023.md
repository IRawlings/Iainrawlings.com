Summary: Cloudfront is a little troublesome!

Welcome to another blog post over here at learning HQ.

Firstly I'd like to list where I got to in terms of setting up the static site via cloudfront, so here goes:

- Pelican installed is installed on my local network on the Raspberry Pi4
- An AWS S3 bucket has been created to house the serve the static content generated by Pelican 
- It is possible to write articles and issue the `make s3_upload` command to drop the files in the S3 bucket
- Cloudfront was added to serve the content at the AWS Edge locations - specifically for America and Europe only at this stage. 
- a certificate was generated for HTTPS on AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and verified by setting the DNS entries for both iainrawlings.com and www.iainrawlings.com
- Presently when visiting the couldfront URL `https://d29wvgb72tkraq.cloudfront.net/` a HTTP 403 error is generated forbidding access. 

It's early in the day, so we'll see what the day brings in terms of a resolution.
