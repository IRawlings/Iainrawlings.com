Summary: Putting things into practice

Here we go!

Pelican has initially been setup within AWS S3 serving the static content, although the pelican software runs on my trusty Raspberry Pi 4 which I use as a home lab of sorts - alongside about three other models of pi.

A nice list of things which still need to be configured at a basic level: 

- Themes
- HTTPS
- Deeper look into the Pelican plugins that would be useful
- Auto content generation
- Write a post explaining a little more about me and the experience I have.
