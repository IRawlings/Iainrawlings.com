# Setting Up Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

Initially, as part of my journey to learning more skills I decided to set up a homelab some time ago. As part of that homelab, I decided I would like to host a blog for a few different reasons:

* A blog would become a place I could document things I learn, allowing me to showcase these where needed.
* The blog would also allow me to talk about different aspects of my homelab and how they're set up - sharing knowledge with others who are learning, like me.
* Blogging provides one of many services that could be run by the home lab
